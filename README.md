Web Trafficking is a common way to measure an online business effectiveness at attracting an audience. Web traffic refers to the amount of data sent and received by visitors to a website. It essentially measures the number of users visiting a website and their activity while on it. It is a crucial indicator of a website's popularity and effectiveness. For monitoring, evaluating and understand the behaviour of the online visitors, web trafficking analysis is very important. Web traffic analysis refers to collecting, measuring, and evaluating the data associated with website users. This analysis helps marketers and website owners to understand user behaviour, identify trends, and optimize the website for better user experience and conversion rates. Key metrics commonly examined include page views, bounce rate, average session duration, and unique visitors. This project aims to analyse web trafficking data to understand the visitor interaction with the website and analyse different traffic source and influential factors of user engagement and conversion.   
This project aims to analyse website user traffic data to understand how visitors interact with a website and identify factors influencing user engagement and conversions. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes various engagement metrics like page views, session duration, bounce rate, traffic source, and conversion behaviour which are the key matrix of web trafficking analysis.

# Objective
•	Analyse and compare user behaviours across different traffic sources.

•	Analyse conversion and bounce rates.

•	Identify the correlation between different metrics.

# Dataset Overview
Data was collected from Kaggle. The main features included in this data set are:

•	Page Views: Number of pages visited in a session

•	Session Duration: Time spent per session

•	Bounce Rate: Percentage of single-interaction sessions

•	Traffic Source: How the user found the site (e.g., Organic, Social, Paid)

•	Previous Visits: Previous visits by the same user

•	Conversion Rate: Whether the session led to a conversion (1=Yes, 0=No)

# Tools Used
•	Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, KPIs, pivot analysis and statistical analysis.

•	Power BI – Dashboard visualization.

# Data Analysis (KPIs) and Key Findings
# Traffic Analysis

•	Total Sessions: 2000

•	Total Page Views 9901

•	Average Session Duration: 3.02

•	Average Time on Page: 4.03

# Interpretation

•	On the basis of total sessions and total page views it can be said that users viewed 5 pages per session on average which indicates a strong sign of interest.

•	The average session duration was 3.02 minutes, which means, users are engaging at a moderate depth.

•	 The average time on page was slightly higher at 4.03 minutes, indicates that users tend to stay on specific pages longer.

# Engagement & Behaviour

•	Average Bounce Rate: 0.28 (28%)

•	Average of Previous Visits: 1.98 

# Interpretation

•	Bounce rate averaged at 28%, which is considered very good (below 40% is generally good). It indicates that 72% of visitors engage beyond a single page.

•	The average number of previous visits was 1.98, meaning almost half of the visitors are returning users, showing loyalty or curiosity.

# Conversion Rate

•	Overall Conversion Rate: 60%

Count of Conversion Rate: Yes- 1206 (60%)
                          No-634 (32%)
# Interpretation

Overall conversion rate is 60% (1,206 "Yes" out of 2,000 sessions), which is exceptionally high. usually anything above 10-15% is impressive for most sites.

# Analysis on the basis of Different Traffic Source

•	Traffic source for highest page views: Referral (3950)

•	Highest average session duration: Referral (3.30)

•	High bounce source: Paid (30%) and Social (30%)

•	Traffie source for highest time on page: Social (4.19)

•	Highest previous visit source: Direct (2.07)

•	Top conversion rate source: Organic (41%)

# Interpretation 
Engagement by source

•	Top Source for engagement and attention is Referral. It leads with 3950 page views and 3.30 minutes session duration

•	Paid and Social traffic sources show the highest bounce rates (30%), implying that users from ads or social may not find what they expect.

•	Social users spend the most time on pages (4.19 minutes) which indicates long reads, maybe less navigation.

•	Direct users have the highest average previous visits (2.07) 

•	Organic traffic converts best at 41%, highlighting the importance of your SEO or search content. Users from search are likely finding what they need and acting on it.

•	Paid traffic only converts at 20% despite good page time, suggesting the traffic quality or targeting might not align with the audience’s intent.

# Correlation Analysis

•	Total Page Views & Average Session Duration is 0.74 which means there are strong positive correlation between these two variables. It also indicates a strong user engagement.

•	Total Page Views & Bounce Rate: is -0.50 which indicate moderate negative correlation that means bounce rate drops with the increase of page views. 

•	Average Session Duration & Conversion Rate is 0.27 which means Weak to moderate positive correlation Users who spend time are somewhat more likely to convert, but time alone doesn't guarantee a sale.

•	Average Time on Page & Bounce Rate is 0.87 which is Very strong positive correlation. Possibly people stay in one page without navigating further.

•	Previous Visits & Conversion Rate is 0.10 which is Very weak positive, indicates that returning users aren’t converting much more then new users.

•	Previous Visits & Session Duration is -0.612, Moderate negative correlation that means returning users stay less time. As they already know the site, they visit, act, and bounce faster.

# Key Findings

•	Top source of engagement is from Referral which means visitors come via links on other websites (blogs, forums, news sites, etc.). So more strategic initiative has to be taken here for attracting more user interest. 

•	Highest conversion rate is from Organic source that means more investment in content and SEO will improve the trafficking. 

•	More initiative to improve the content that hold attention should be taken to attract the attention of user in social media.

•	Email campaigns or loyalty program should be increase to hold the attraction of return visitor.
